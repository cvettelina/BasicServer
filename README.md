# BasicServer
Implement a simple web server using Java. The server has to be like a message 'hub'. The user should be able to register, to login, to send messages to the server and to be able to read all stored unread messages from the server (only if they have logged in successfully).

+ The server should accept standard HTTP GET and POST requests.
+ The client sending the requests must use curl.
+ Do not use standard java libraries for HTTP stuff
